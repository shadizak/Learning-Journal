An IDE(Integrated Development Environment) like Visual Studio, Xcode provide facilities for editing text while also being able to compile a project and debug an executable. IDEs are built for developing software. They typically have compilers and debuggers bundled with the program.

# What features should you look for in a text editor?

2. Syntax highlighting
3. A nice variety of themes

# What is The Command Line!?
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

# Haw to Opening a Terminal?
1. If you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.
2. If on Linux then you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities. Alternatively you may be able to 'right-click' on the desktop and there may be an option 'Open in terminal'.
