# *Growth Mindset* 

 
This is summary of Markdown:
 
In a growth mindset, this mindset knows no surrender or fear of trying or learning new things. Trying is a great job and feedback can be taken from a failed experiment, like any skill that can be developed with hard work and perseverance. I have a growth mindset with a passion for self-learning and withstand the difficulties of doing a great job.

keep yourself in a growth mindset Via:

1. never give up or no to surrender
2. I will get my great achievement after working hard
3. Try and then try
