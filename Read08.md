# What is an Operator in JS?

simple expression 4 + 5 is equal to 9. Here 4 and 5 are called operands and ‘+’ is called the operator.
JavaScript supports the following types of operators.

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Comparison Operators
3. Logical (or Relational) Operators
4. Assignment Operators
5. Conditional (or ternary) Operators

## Comparison Operators
1. == (Equal)
Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes, then the condition becomes true.

2. != (Not Equal)
Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.

3. > (Greater than)
Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true.


4. < (Less than)
Checks if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true.


5. >= (Greater than or Equal to)
Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true.


6. <= (Less than or Equal to)
Checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true.


7. ===	equal value and equal Data type

8. !==	not equal value or not equal Data type

# What is an Loops in JS?
## JavaScript While Loop
Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
-> Syntax:
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
